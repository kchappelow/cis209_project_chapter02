**Part 1**: *Financial application, compound value*. Suppose you save **$100** each month into a savings account with the annual interest rate of 5%. Thus, the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account becomes

100* (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417

After the second month, the value in the account becomes

(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252

After the third month, the value in the account becomes

(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507

and so on.

Task #Part 1: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays the account value after the sixth month. 

Be sure to use comments and coding styles as discussed in class.

Here is a sample run:

```
Enter the monthly saving amount: 100
After the sixth month, the account value is $608.81
```

**Part 2**: *Cost of driving*, Write a program that prompts the user to enter the distance to drive, the fuel efficiency of the car in miles per gallon, and the price per gallon, and displays the cost of the trip.

Here is a sample run:

```
Enter the driving distance: 900.5
Enter miles per gallon: 25.5
Enter price per gallon: 3.55
The cost of driving is $125.36
```

Submit the homework using git.
